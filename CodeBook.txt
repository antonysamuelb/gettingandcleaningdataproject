Getting and Cleaning Data: Project
==================================

NOTE: Kindly understand the source data in order to make sense of the current analysis. 
The "readMe.txt" has more information on this.

The purpose of this project is to process the source data provided (from 
"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip")
 and convert into a form that is tidy.

An R script "run_analysis.R" has been created for this purpose.
The following functions are performed by the script.

1. Downloads, unzips and loads required data from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip". 
  	- The training data is stored in trainData object.
  	- The testing data is stored in testData object.
	- The column names are stored in the featureNames object.
	- The activity names corresponding to each activity's number 
	  is stored in activityNames object.

2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	- The rbind function is used to merge both the data. 
	- The merged data is stored in mergeDF.

3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	- The grep function is used to find all column names (stored 
	  in featureNames object) containing "mean()" or "std()".
	- The columns thus are stored in the reqDF object.
	- NOTE: Kindly refer to "readMe.txt" to understand the 
	  reasoning behind choosing "mean()" and not "mean".

4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
	- The factor function is used to descriptively label all 
	  activities.
	- Columns activity and subject, containing respective 
	  information, is added to reqDF.

5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	- The names function is used to name the columns of the reqDF 
	  data frame using character variables obatined from 
	  featureNames.

6. From the data set in step 5, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	- The ddply function from the plyr package is used to perform 
	  the required operation to get the tidy data set.
	- The tidy data set is stored in the "tidyData.txt" file. 
	- NOTE: Kindly refer to the "readMe.txt" so as to understand 
	  how the current data fits the idea of tidy data.
